## Project Title: Reproducible machine learning: A review of representation learning approaches for drug discovery

Objective: The goal  of this project is to replicate the machine learning paper work : 
[Neural message passing for Quantum Chemistry] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) from Gilmer et al. 

The following are the models that were implemented/experimented with using PyTorch Geometric.


BoB:
     [Bag of Bonds] (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00831) from Hansen et Al. 


CM:
    [Coulomb Matrix] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2618 )from Rupp et Al.
    
     
MPPN: 
    [Message Passing Neural Network (ens2)] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) from Gilmer et al. 

     
GG-NN: 
      [Gated Graph Recurrent Neural Network] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493) from Li et Al.
      
     
GG-NN+BOND: 
      [Gated Graph Recurrent Neural Network + Bond as a Node feature] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493) from Li et Al.
      
     
GSAGE+BOND: 
     [GraphSage + Bond as a Node feature]  (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216) from Hamilton et Al.
