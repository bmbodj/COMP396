##Project Title: Reproducible machine learning: A review of representation learning approaches for drug discovery

Objective: The goal  of this project is to replicate the machine learning paper work : 
[Neural message passing for Quantum Chemistry] from Gilmer et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) 

The following are the models that were implemented/experimented with using PyTorch Geometric.


BoB:
     [Bag of Bonds] from Hansen et Al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00831)


CM:
    [Coulomb Matrix] from Rupp et Al.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.2618) 
    
     
MPPN: 
    [Message Passing Neural Network (ens2)] from Gilmer et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212) 

     
GG-NN: 
      [Gated Graph Recurrent Neural Network] from Li et Al.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493)
      
     
GG-NN+BOND: 
      [Gated Graph Recurrent Neural Network + Bond as a Node feature] from Li et Al.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05493)
      
     
GSAGE+BOND: 
     [GraphSage + Bond as a Node feature] from Hamilton et Al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216)
